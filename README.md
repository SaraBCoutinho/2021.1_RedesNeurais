# 2021.1_RedesNeurais

Project develloped during the neural network course of the pos-graduation program at Cin-UFPE. 
Semester: 2020.2
Group: Adriano Marabuco, Jair Paulino, Sara Coutinho. 

Focusing on the actual problem of traffic accidents, we idealized one solution to solve this base on the velocity data. 
We did a study considering the spatial-temporal vision, focusing on data about the Recife-Brazil, and the time considering 12 hours of registers. 
We did a neural network to modeling the input, based on velocite data, and output , based on accident registers.
